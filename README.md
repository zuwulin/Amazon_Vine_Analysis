## Overview
The following analysis was performed in order to investigate whether any favoring bias exists within the amazon purchasing community when using vine paid review program versus unpaid regular reviews provided by customers when it comes to downloadable video game content. The investigation is done because it is possible that paid reviews will result in more favourable item reviews.

## Results
The results are presented below:

* Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a definitive analysis of potential biases arising from paid vine program, as it turned out that none of the available reviews within the downloadable video game content category were provided via the vine partnership program.

## Summary
As stated above, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer as to the bias of paid vine reviews, as no paid reviews were found for the product category analyzed. That being said, one possible avenue that can be taken in order to investigate the potential vine bias is to recreate the current analysis with a different amazon item category. Additionally, if the results in a different category would be inconclusive, it might be a good idea to investigate the amount of helpful votes received on paid versus unpaid reviews, which could potentially provide further insight in the biases of paid review program.
